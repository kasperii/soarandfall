<p><strong>Lessons learned</strong>
By working together on this project we have learned to divide workload and streamline the workflow. We have also learned to use ARCore in combination with Unity. Everyone in the group have also developed their knowledge even more in different areas such as AR multiplayer, post-processing effects, shadow rendering on AR surfaces etc.

  <strong>Testimony</strong>
  </p><p>
  <strong>What was your overall impression?</strong>
It was very fun, I tried it in the early stages of development and it’s a huge improvement
</p><p>
<strong>What was difficult with the program?</strong>
I didn’t want to read a lot of text to understand how it works, I want to just be able to understand it immediately.
</p><p>
<strong>What did you think about the graphics?</strong>
They were great, I liked how the two levels were different from each other as well as having the obstacles move
</p><p>
<strong>What did you think about the interaction?</strong>
I had to put my arms up really high to reach the beams and it was quite unergonomic. Otherwise good.

<strong>Tips from Lucas </strong>
</p><p>
If collaborating and working with Unity use Unity’s collab feature. Even though the max roof is three people. You will save time compared to using GitHub.

</p><p>
Have someone in charge of UX and begin with user tests as early as possible. You get very bogged down in your own project and it’s difficult to see outside the box.
</p><p>
Communication is key! Have a continuation of short meetings to update everyone on what’s happening. It’s not sure everyone are on the same page.
</p><p>
Do not work in isolation for too long! Merge sub-branches as fast as something is working. Wait with merging for too long could make merging time consuming in later stages.
