<strong>To build a</strong> game that could last longer than the bare minimum for a presentation, has to be built in a stable matter. This game is build to be scalable and modable freely. Not only can we freelyt change the size of the work, we can also add new blocks, new items and new crafting recipies easilty.

<strong>
This demo is</strong> built to last and features a in editor level desinger tool. It allows you to choose blocks types and shapes, combine them and place them wherever wanted within the biome boundaries. A preview system allows you to see where the item or block you’re placing is going to be.

<strong>
    In the future</strong>, we would work towars a editor with options to add new crafting recipes, narrator triggers, etc… It would enable a really fast creation of stories and worlds while separating it from the creation of the game engine itself. It could also be given to the players for them to create their own stories and worlds.
