<p>My main goal during this project has been to lift the effect of the light beams being in the physical room. First implementation was by creating light sourcec along the light beams - this proved to be challanging
  since lightsources are rarely linear. <a href=https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/VolumetricLighting> Tube light</a>, volymetric light and emission workes best if baked (pre calculated light maps). Non-real time light was not an option.
</p><p>
As Robin persued post processing effects on the light - this would create local effect of light.
I chose to focus on the floor. What if I would create a shader that took the light beam location and
light up the detected plane mesh.
</p><p>
Since the light works as a line, the calculations would not be to hard. The start- and end-points is all that is needed.

This animation above shows how relative placement between the pixel and the start point of the light beam can affect the hue of the plane.

I succesfully managed to make an relative angle between the "start of the light beam",the pixel and the camera affect the hue of the pixel. The angle of how you look at the surface shows different light - as in a real reflection.

Unfortunately this is where I am so far. My calculation manage somehow break the reflection. I will keep you posted on further development.

<p>
  I have, besides shaders, developed this site, designed artwork and posters, doing research and, most of all, helped debugging.
