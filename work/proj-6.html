  I have been responsible for a lot of the graphical aspects of the game.
  This includes trying out different materials, textures, and shaders.
  In trying to make the light beam better looking I’ve experimented with a shader,
  called MK Glow, which creates a glow effect. In Unity I can easily change the intensity,
  color and fall off of the light. The light script works by placing a cylinder on the
  lines created from a ray cast. Below is a example of how the light beam gets placed on the
  ray cast’s path:

To further enhance the light and also the overall look of the game I’ve used Post
Processing effects. Adding a simple bloom effect gives the light further intensity.
Using basic Color Correction (CC) I can also make the virtual world blend better with
the real world the player see through the camera. This includes manipulating contrast,
light levels and color curves. It’s also possible to add the post processing effects to
different layers, this makes it possible to change post processing on different objects independently.
