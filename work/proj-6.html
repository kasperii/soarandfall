    <strong>To provide an</strong> immersive game experience, we decided to have both ambient sounds and music that goes well together with the overall game. The importance of background music in video games is very importance, as described in “The Influence of Background Music of Video Games on Immersion”, where the authors describe it as “[i]t can not only provide an audio complement to action on the screen but also help create a sense of a real physical space” (Xiaoqing Fu, J.Z. 2015).

<strong>This was something</strong> that we tried to implement to provide this sense of immersion. By looking into different sounds that fitted the aesthetics of the game, we could find a few elements that helped us in our decision. First of all, the graphics is low poly and its set in a world that is not exactly like our real world: the main character is a cube and the world is made up of flying islands, therefore we could take some creative decisions of how the overall feeling should be. When it comes to the ambient sounds, we decided on having it somewhat real however: the sound of water, wind, trees, fire cracking, chopping down a tree, etc. where all made up of real sounds. The music, however, was made up of one synthesizer that played a loop of X seconds. The sounds were made with a OP-1 synthesizer from Teenage Engineering, which is known for its bank of “fun” sounds, meaning that the sounds are to a large extent made from FM synthesis and provide sounds that are largely similar to historic games with fewer bits. </p>
