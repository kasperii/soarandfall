  </a>
</p><p>
  This first paper wants to challenge the heavy focus on vision in AR that most research have. They explore the role that multimodal and non-visual aspects can have when creating AR scenarios, and argue that multimodality is the norm rather than the exception in AR.

  Player Control in a Real-Time Mobile Augmented Reality Game
</a>
</p><p>
  This second paper talks about how controls in AR needs to be quite innovative, as you need to design for the device to always have the AR world in view while controlling. The paper also proposes different interaction concepts based on combinations of both physical and virtual buttons and sensor inputs.
