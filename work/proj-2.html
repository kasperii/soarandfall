<strong>
The game is</strong> about a character who lives in a parallel dimension to ours. A world where gravity is working in different ways and things look different than our world. The main character is a Cubanoid (a creature made up of cubes), it lives in a tent on a peaceful flying island. Its island is fruitful with many different climates: water and rivers; sand and earth; trees and fruits, etc. Life in the world of flying islands is peaceful. One day, the Cubanoid wakes up and realizes that its island have been split into many pieces. A voice talks to it in a sarcastic and mocking way, telling it that its former home has indeed been split into pieces. The voice tells it that its island is just a small part of what it once was. In the Cubanoid despair, it realizes that its friends, family and properties have been spread out on different parts of the once big island. Where are its properties? Where are its friends? The god-like voice tells him that they are alive on another flying island and that he can get there if he manages to build his way across the islands that are in between. The Cubanoid embarks upon a journey to find its friends and family, the only weapon it brings with it is its innovative curiosity.
</p><p>    The journey begins with the Cubanoid examining its island (biome) for materials that it can build something to get to another biome. It finds an axe and starts chopping wood from a nearby tree. It also finds some rope and in a short time, the Cubanoid have built a bridge to another biome.
</p><p>    On the second biome, it finds some of its best friends stuff. It recognizes the trees as well, this was its best friend's home. By chopping more wood, it realizes that it can combine some nails that are laying around into a ladder. In this way, the Cubanoid can climb up to another biome that is soaring just above it.
</p><p>    On this third biome, the climate is somewhat different. There are rivers and waterfalls that makes it harder to get around. There aren't any stuff laying around either - how is it going to make anything here that can take it further? After going back to the previous biome, the Cubanoid brings with it a bucket and fills it with the water from the new biome. It waters some flowers that are growing next to it, and all of a sudden, the flowers grows and grows, building a bridge over to a new biome! Lucky, the Cubanoid thinks to itself. The god-like voice laughs at it and says “Well aren't you lucky? Who could have thought that some flowers would take you to the next island - you sure are a clever little cube.”
</p><p>    On the fourth island, the Cubanoid encounters new problems: there are quicksand that looks life-threatening. And there are no stuff laying around, what should the Cubanoid do?
</p><p>After a while, the Cubanoid accidentally gets stuck in the sand and is being drawn down by the force of the quicksand. In its panic it cannot move and is slowly being drawn down to meet the end. But then, something strange happens - the Cubanoid sinks through the island and falls down to another one. Now it realizes that this was the best that could happen - it managed to progress through the track of islands accidentally.
</p><p>    And now to the best part, it hears familiar voices from the island next to it. There they are, its friends and family are waving at it from the next island. The Cubanoid has almost made it. One last challenge left. The island it is standing on is made up of lava and underneath there is a cave with mushrooms. How should the Cubanoid manage to build something here? It picks up the mushrooms and takes them to the fire, at least it might be edible and might even taste good once it is grilled. But then all of a sudden the mushroom starts bubbling and slowly turning into a bridge over to the final island. It was a magic mushroom! The Cubanoid runs over the bridge and sees all of his friends and family gathered, where they all cheer on him and our game has finally reached its happy ending.
