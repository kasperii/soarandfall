<strong>The player will</strong> start on, what we call the home biome, where it has it’s tent, and some tools to begin crafting. It will start with instructions from the narrator to find paths between the biomes, to connect to, and lastly find it’s family. For every puzzle the player solves, it can build a “bridge” to get to the next biome. 
</p><p><strong>
The puzzles are</strong> now not necessary to solve to procede at this stage of development since our cube has the ability to soar endlessly in the sky. User studies showed that our jumping ability was highly liked by our players. We have discussed in our group how to keep the challange and the soaring - an idea for the future is that the puzzles spawn new biomes to explore. An other option has been suggested that only within explored biomes is the cubion able to soar - elsewhere you fall.  As it is now: The player cannot fly to high, neither to low. When trying to fly to high, the player will stop progressng in the upwards direction when a hard limit is reached. And when flying to low (or falling) the player will respawn on it’s home biome.

<strong>Every item</strong> have a customisable script that dictates it’s behaviour when the player decides to interact with it. This way, creative and unique actions can happen between the player and the game objects, or even between object themselves. You could even imagine a cascading interaction chain that serves to make the player progress further.

<strong>The player can</strong>  only carry four items in the inventory, and one in its hands. The player can pick up, and drop the items that it’s holding in it hands. It also needs to hold the objects it wants to interact with in its hands, and standing close to the object the player want to combine with. There are two types of combinations, crafting and interacting. For example, chopping a tree with an axe is crafting, since you are using up the elements you are combining. While watering a flower is interacting, since all of the elements remains after a combination.

<p>The player can, not only use keyboard but also use console controller - the  controlls are as following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A : Jumps</li>
<li>X : Grab or release an object</li>
<li>Y : Interact with another item, like using an axe on a tree</li>
<li>B : Craft</li>
<li>Left and Right bumpers : Rotate the camera by 90 degrees</li>
<li>Start : Open inventory / Pause menu</li>
<li>Left joystick : Move</li>
</ul>
