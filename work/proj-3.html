  I was responsible for the multiplayer aspect of the game or rather the networking and the object synchronization between phones. That was easier said than done and my initial idea was to only use ARCore’s Cloud Anchors. Something I discovered was that it’s great for only sharing one static virtual object. In the end I needed to combine Cloud Anchors with multiplayer networking to synchronize the virtual objects between phones. A single cloud anchor acted as the world space for everything to refer to.

I was also in charge of merging everything together to a cohesive project at the end which was a big project in itself.

Tips
If collaborating and working with Unity use Unity’s collab feature. Even though the max roof is three people. You will save time compared to using GitHub.
Have someone in charge of UX and begin with user tests as early as possible. You get very bogged down in your own project and it’s difficult to see outside the box.
Communication is key! Have a continuation of short meetings to update everyone on what’s happening. It’s not sure everyone are on the same page.
Do not work in isolation for too long! Merge sub-branches as fast as something is working. Wait with merging for too long could make merging time consuming in later stages.
