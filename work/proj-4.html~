<strong>Much of the</strong> game follows a very flat and low poly design. Most of the assets are self made. The skybox is made using illustrator and puzzled into a cube in unity.
The textures are also created by us.

<strong> To make the </strong> visual impact of the game more dynamic we developed own shaders for out water and waterfalls. These shaders does both animate the water and animate a flow and loss of opacity, borderless to the water source, for the waterfall.

Besides the game
</strong> aesthetics, we also worked with the UI and PR materials. There menues are are fully functional, and could be used to reset, to save or load a game file.
